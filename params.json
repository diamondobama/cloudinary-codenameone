{"name":"Cloudinary-CodenameOne","tagline":"Codename One library for Cloudinary","body":"# Cloudinary Codename One\r\n\r\nThis library adds support for the [Cloudinary](http://cloudinary.com/) image management service to Codename One apps.  The library itself is a direct port of the [Cloudinary Java SDK](http://cloudinary.com/documentation/java_integration).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n1. Download the [latest release of cloudinary-codenameone.cn1lib](https://github.com/shannah/cloudinary-codenameone/releases/latest) and copy it into your project's \"lib\" directory.\r\n2. Download [BouncyCastleCN1Lib.cn1lib](https://github.com/chen-fishbein/bouncy-castle-codenameone-lib/raw/master/BouncyCastleCN1Lib.cn1lib) and copy it into your project's \"lib\" directory.\r\n2. Select \"Codename One\" > \"Refresh Libs\"\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nRefer to the [Cloudinary Java Integration Guide's Configuration Section](http://cloudinary.com/documentation/java_integration#configuration) for configuration information.  \r\n\r\nMy preferred configuration in a Codename One app is to place the following inside my app's `init()` method:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport com.cloudinary.Cloudinary;\r\n\r\n...\r\nCloudinary cloudinary;\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\npublic void init() {\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n    \r\n    Cloudinary cloudinary = new Cloudinary(ObjectUtils.asMap(\r\n      \"cloud_name\", \"my_cloud_name\",\r\n      \"api_key\", \"my_api_key\",\r\n      \"api_secret\", \"my_api_secret\"));\r\n      \r\n      \r\n    // Disable private CDN URLs as this doesn't seem to work with free accounts\r\n    cloudinary.config.privateCdn = false;\r\n    \r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nReleased under the MIT license. \r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n* [JavaDocs](http://shannah.github.io/cloudinary-codenameone/javadoc/)\r\n* [Cloudinary Java Integration Guide](http://cloudinary.com/documentation/java_integration) - Most of this should be applicable to the Codename One Library\r\n* [Cloudinary Documentation Main Page](http://cloudinary.com/documentation/)\r\n* [Demo Codename One App](https://github.com/shannah/cloudinary-codenameone/blob/master/src/com/codename1/cloudinary/CloudinaryDemo.java)\r\n\r\n## Building from Source\r\n\r\nCheck out the source from github:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/shannah/cloudinary-codenameone.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis project is missing the following files that you will need to copy from another NetBeans codename One project.\r\n\r\n* JavaSE.jar\r\n* lib/CLDC11.jar\r\n* lib/CodenameOne.jar\r\n* lib/CodenameOne_src.zip\r\n* CodenameOneBuildClient.jar\r\n\r\nOnce you have copied all of these files into the project, you can just open the project in Netbeans and build it.  \r\n\r\nIf you run the project it will load a minimal demo app in the simulator that uses Cloudinary.  You'll need to adjust the cloudinary credentials [here](https://github.com/shannah/cloudinary-codenameone/blob/master/src/com/codename1/cloudinary/CloudinaryDemo.java#L28) to match your cloudinary account for the demo to work.\r\n\r\nIf you build the project, you will find the built cn1lib file at dist/cloudinary-codenameone.cn1lib\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
